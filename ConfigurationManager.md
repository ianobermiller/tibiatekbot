# Introduction #

The Configuration Manager is a tool that allows the user to automatically use commands of the bot when a certain character logins.


# How to Use #

To open the Configuration Manager's editable text box use the command **&config edit**.
On the text box write each command on a separate line.

After pressing **Ok** all changes will be saved under this file:
`{TTB Root}\Profiles\{Character World}\{Character Name}\config.txt`

**Note <sup>1</sup>:** this file can also be edited from any other text editor.

To manually load the Configuration Manager changes use the command **&config load**.
