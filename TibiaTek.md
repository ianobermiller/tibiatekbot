# Introduction #
The TibiaTek Development Team currently develops applications for the MMORPG game called Tibia. The main project right now is [TibiaTek Bot](TibiaTekBot.md) v2.1 (TTB).

The team was officially formed after OsQu became a developer for [TibiaTek Bot](TibiaTekBot.md). This happened around the middle stages of the development phase of [TibiaTek Bot](TibiaTekBot.md) v2, during the first months of 2007. Almost at the end of 2007 we are proud to introduce new team members: Dump3r and NeWsOfTzzz.
